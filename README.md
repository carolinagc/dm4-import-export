Version History
---------------

**0.4**, Upcoming

- Improve exported SVG Document about using Defs:
  [http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/struct.html#DefsElement](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/struct.html#DefsElement)
- Test improved text export (e.g. with Inkscape) about textArea:
  [http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/text.html#TextAreaElement](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/text.html#TextAreaElement)
- Investigate if wheter [.graphml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphML) (e.g. for yEd) or `.mm` (used in Freemind) is another valuable export format. I currently assume that `.mm` is to restricted to house topic maps (cause mind maps usually have _one_ central topic not many) and one topicmap would translate to many mind maps (one for each "cluster" in the topic map).
