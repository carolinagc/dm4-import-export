DMX Import Export
=================

A DMX plugin to 

- Export single DMX Topicmaps (JSON)
- Import single DMX Topicmaps (JSON)
- Import Firefox Bookmarks Backup Files (JSON)
- Import Chrome/Chromium Bookmarks Backups (HTML)

Usage

Next to the Topicmap dropdown menu:

- Export: Trigger the "Export Topicmap" command if you want to save the current Topicmap as JSON file
- Import: Trigger the "Upload Dialog" command and select your file to import. You will be guided through the import process.

Requirements
------------

A DMX 5.0-beta-7 installation
https://github.com/jri/deepamehta#readme


Installation
------------

1. Download the DMX Import/Export plugin:

2. Move the DMX Import/Export plugin to the `dmx/bundle-deploy` folder.

3. Restart DMX.

Research
--------

- Improve exported SVG Document about using Defs:
  [http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/struct.html#DefsElement](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/struct.html#DefsElement)
- Test improved text export (e.g. with Inkscape) about textArea:
  [http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/text.html#TextAreaElement](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/text.html#TextAreaElement)
- Investigate if wheter [.graphml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphML) (e.g. for yEd) or `.mm` (used in Freemind) is another valuable export format. I currently assume that `.mm` is to restricted to house topic maps (cause mind maps usually have _one_ central topic not many) and one topicmap would translate to many mind maps (one for each "cluster" in the topic map).
